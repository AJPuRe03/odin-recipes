    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Oreo cookies: This recipe starts with a package of Oreo cookies (or your
        preferred chocolate sandwich cookies with white filling).
      </li>
      <li>Butter: Half a stick of salted butter lends richness and flavor.</li>
      <li>
        Cream cheese: Of course, you’ll need softened cream cheese for these
        cream cheese bars.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: A cup of white sugar lends the perfect amount of sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>Sour cream: Sour cream adds creaminess and subtle tangy flavor.</li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Three eggs give the bars richness and help bind the batter
        together.
      </li>
      <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor.</li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt also enhances the flavor, but it won’t make the
        bars taste salty.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with heavy-duty foil, allowing 2 inches of
        overhang on two opposite sides of the pan. Coat foil lightly with
        nonstick cooking spray; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 30 cookies in a food processor. Cover and pulse until finely
        ground.
      </li>
      <li>Add melted butter and pulse just until combined.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer mixture to the prepared pan. Press crumbs evenly into the
        bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl and beat with
        an electric mixer on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sour cream, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Beat until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coarsely crush the remaining oreos by placing them in a resealable bag
        and hitting it with a rolling pin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reserve 1/2 cup of the cookie crumbs. Fold the remaining crumbs into the
        batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter evenly over pre-baked crust, smoothing the top as necessary.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle with reserved cookie crumbs.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the center appears set, with a slight
        jiggle, 35 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool in a pan on a wire rack for 2 hours, or until completely cool.
        Cover and chill for at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Remove uncut bars from the pan by lifting foil.</li>
      <li>Cut into 2x2-inch bars to serve.</li>
    </ol>
