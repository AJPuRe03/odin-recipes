    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>¾ cup lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
      <li>⅔ (20 ounce) package Mexican Maria cookies (galletas Maria)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        whisk until mixture is thick and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a glass bowl or trifle dish with Maria cookies and cover them with
        a generous layer of the milk mixture. Add another layer of biscuits and
        milk. Continue the layering, ending with a layer of the milk mixture.
